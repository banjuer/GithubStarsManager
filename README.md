## ✨ Features

- **🚀 Monolith Architecture**: Single-container deployment. Backend serves frontend on port 3000 (mapped to 8080).
- **📱 PWA Support**: Install as a desktop or mobile app for a native experience.
- **🤖 AI Analysis**: Auto-summarize repository content and generate intelligent tags.
- **📂 Smart Management**: Automatic categorization and custom folders.
- **🔔 Release Tracking**: Subscribe to repo updates and receive notifications via **Apprise**.
- **🔍 Semantic Search**: Find repositories by intent (triggered by `Enter`).
- **👥 Multi-User**: Isolated data with JWT authentication and SuperAdmin role.
- **💾 SQLite Persistence**: All library data stored in the container at `/app/data/data.db`.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Deployment)

### 🐳 Run With Docker (Recommended)

You can run the application instantly using the pre-built image from Docker Hub.

#### Option 1: Docker CLI (Fastest)

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:3000 \
  -v gsm-data:/app/data \
  --name gsm \
  banjuer/github-stars-manager:latest
```

#### Option 2: Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: banjuer/github-stars-manager:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:3000"
    volumes:
      - app-data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  app-data:
```

Then run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

- **URL**: `http://localhost:8080`
- **First Run**: The first registered user automatically becomes the **SuperAdmin**.
- **Persistence**: Data is saved in the `app-data` volume.

## Who it's for

- Long-time developers with 1000+ stars.
- Users who need systematic release tracking.
- Enthusiasts wanting to catalog tools with AI assistance.

## Additional Notes

1. The backend is optional but recommended for web deployment. Without it, all data is stored in your browser's localStorage — back up important data regularly.
2. I can't write code, this app is entirely written by the AI, mainly for my personal requirment. If you have a new feature or meet a bug, I can only try to do it, but I can't guarantee it, because it depends on the AI to do it successfully.😹
